[clvrk](https://github.com/clvrk) - After tuning into Mercury's development streams, I can say without a doubt that his proficiency in Web development is un-peered by people his age and he stands among those with experience. He has helped me out with API related questions and is capable of making straight-forward & clean Websites half of the devs these days couldn't even dream of developing.

[Milo](https://github.com/Iapetus-11/) - Kevin and I have been through a lot, teaching each other many things as we have traversed the world of programming. Without him, I wouldn't have learned JavaScript and probably would still be using thonny as an IDE.
